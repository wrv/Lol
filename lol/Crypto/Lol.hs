-- This module re-exports primary interfaces, and should be the only import
-- needed for most cryptographic application implmenetations. To instantiate an
-- application with concrete types, you will also need to import
-- "Crypto.Lol.Types".
--
-- Below is a brief mathematical background which serves as reference
-- material for reading the documentation.
--
--   * \( \Z \) denotes the ring of integers, \( \Q \) is the rational numbers,
--     \( \R \) denotes the real numbers, and \( \C \) represents the complex
--     numbers.
--
--   * \( \Z_q = \Z/(q\Z) \) is the integers mod \( q \). \( \Z_q \) is
--     implemented in "Crypto.Lol.Types.ZqBasic".
--
--   * The finite field of order \( p \) is denoted \( \F_{p} \), and is
--     implemented in "Crypto.Lol.Types.FiniteField".
--
--   * \( \zeta_m \in R \) is an arbitrary element of order \( m \) in a
--     ring \( R \).
--
--   * Throughout, \( m \) denotes a cyclotomic /index/. In code, the cyclotomic
--     index is represented by the type parameter @m :: 'Factored'@.
--
--   * The ring \( R=\O_m=\Z[\zeta_m] \) is the \( m \)th cyclotomic ring.
--     We denote the quotient ring \( \Z_q[\zeta_m]) \) by \( R_q \).
--     We refer to \( \Z \) or \( \Z_q \) as the /base ring/.
--     Cyclotomic rings are encapsulated by "Crypto.Lol.Cyclotomic.Cyc".
--
--   * \( n=\varphi(m) \) is the totient function of the cyclotomic index.
--     This is the dimension of a cyclotomic ring over the base ring.
